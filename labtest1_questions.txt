### Robotics lab - 221 LIA 001 
#### lab test - 1  
#### November 22, 2022 
#### Test duration: 1 hour 

Instructions
============
1. The lab test is a mix of theory and viva questions
2. clone the assignment folder on to your PC
3. Once you have completed the test, commit to the remote assignment folder with the commit message 'lab_test1_submission'
4. Answers that require you to type in answers are to be entered in a text file named <your name>.txt and commited to the assignment folder. 
5. You have to copy the question along with the question number from the file 'labtest1.questions.txt on to the txt file in istruction 4. Then type in the answer below.
6. For questions that require you to submit screencast, save them to videos folder with the proper file name mentioned in the question.

Note: Screencast is to be done with builtin screen recorder of Ubuntu 20.04.
default duration of screencast is 30 seconds. This would be sufficient for our lab test.
To modify the duration of screencast use the terminal command
gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys max-screencast-length <duration in seconds>

**********Test Questions***********
===================================
1. Create a ros package 'lab_test1_pkg' .
- The scripts created as answers to the questions that follow are to be part of the package 'lab_test1_pkg'
- For submitting the test copy the package 'lab_test1_pkg' to the cloned assignment folder and commit to remote assignment folder

2. Write and execute python script based publisher subscriber. 

# Publisher
- The publisher name should be <your first name>_pub
- Topic name should be 'robotics_labtest1'
- Publish a string message 'hello robotics lab' at intervals of 3 seconds
- Run until the node is stopped by keyboard interrupt
- Save the script as <yourname>_lab_pub1.py
- Execute the script

In the text file '<your name>.txt' type down the answers to the following questions:

2.1. What are the nodes currently running. write down their names
2.2. What topics are currently running. write down their names
2.3. Screencast the terminal outputs of questions 2.1 and 2.2. Save the file in the video folder as one_pub.webm
2.4. What happens if you try to launch a currently running publisher in another terminal
2.5. Modify the code to simultaneously run three instances of the publisher
2.6. On executing the code modified in step 2.5 :
    a) What are the nodes currently running. write down their names
    b) What topics are currently running. write down their names
    c) launch rqt_graph. record screen. save the video as multiple_pub.webm
    d) Uncheck the option 'debug' in rqt_graph gui and record screen. Save as multiple_pub_debug.webm
    e) Comment on the observation in step d
2.7. What is the use of rospy.loginfo().

# Subscriber

- Create a subscribe to the topic 'robotics_labtest1'. Name of the subscriber should be <your first name>_sub
- Subscriber should run until it is stopped 

2.8. What are the nodes currently running. write down their names
2.9. What are the topics currently running. write down their names
2.10. Screencast the terminal outputs of questions 2.8 and 2.9. Save the file in the video folder as one_sub.webm
2.11. What happens if you try to launch a currently running subscriber in another terminal
2.12. Modify the code to simultaneously run three instances of the publisher
2.13. On executing the code modified in step 2.12 :
    a) What are the nodes currently running. write down their names
    b) What topics are currently running. write down their names
    c) launch rqt_graph. record screen. save the video as multiple_pub.webm
    d) Uncheck the option 'debug' in rqt_graph gui and record screen. Save as multiple_sub_debug.webm
    e) Comment on the observation in step d
